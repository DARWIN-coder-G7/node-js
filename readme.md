console.log("Hello World!");
//Here there is no window object hence using global
console.log(global);

//Type node space file name to run the file

As of now import is not available because Es6 is not available in NODE
so import wont work here so we have to use require()

instead of .js if we use .mjs we can use es6 in node js or we can mention that in package.json as set type:module in package .json too ---- These all to make the import statement as workable
